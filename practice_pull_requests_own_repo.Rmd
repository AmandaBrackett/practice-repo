See an example of making a pull request to your own repository [here](https://r-pkgs.org/git.html#git-pullreq) in the R Packages book.

# Make a new branch
 
Pull requests are simplest when making a pull request to your own repo.  The first step is to make a new branch.  If you have no collaborators or if all collaborators work via pull requests you generally won't need to worry about things on the repo changing while you're working (these are called "upstream changes").  

You can make a new branch within RStudio or on GitHub (if you do this on GitHub remember to Pull to local repository).  Be sure to switch to new branch and start editing your first file.

## Make commit

Commit your changes and push up to the branch.

## Make pull request on GitHub

On GitHub in branch has a "Compare and pull request button".  Push this button and add in information to describe what you edited and why.  

## Continue making commits

You can merge the pull request in at that time, but you can also continue to make commits and push to the branch.  All changes will be added to pull request.

## Merge

When you're done for the day or done with a particular set of edits, merge things to the main branch on GitHub.  You'll be given the option to delete the branch, which is recommended.  Your next task can be done in a new branch with a new pull request.
