# Pull requests

Pull requests to other repos takes more steps.  Since it's not your own repo you need to worry about upstream changes happening while you are making a pull request.  Here are the manual steps for doing the work, which involves both RStudio drop-down menus as well as Shell commands.  See a good review [here](https://r-bio.github.io/intro-git-rstudio/).

## Fork on GitHub

First you Fork on GitHub.  If the change is minor, you could quickly make a new branch and do the edits and pull request from there.  But you likely want to make a local copy so you can do the work from RStudio/your local computer.

##  Indicate upstream version of project

The repo could be updated while you are making a pull request.  So you need to enter the address of the upstream repository and do `git remote add upstream https://url-to-repository` in the Shell.

## Create a branch

Make a new branch for the fixes.  This can be done in the RStudio Git Pane.

## Make changes

Do any edits you want, and then commit.
