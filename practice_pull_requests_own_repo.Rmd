# Pull requests
 
Pull requests can take quite a few steps.  When making a pull request to your own repo, you first will want to make a new branch.  If you have no collaborators, worrying about upstream changes won't be as important. See some info [here](https://r-pkgs.org/git.html#git-pullreq) in the R Packages book.

You can make a new branch within RStudio or on GitHub (and then pull branch in).  Be sure to switch to new branch and start editing your first file.

## Make commit

Commit changes and push up to the branch.

## Make pull request on GitHub

On GitHub in branch has a "Compare and pull request button".  Push this and add in information to describe process.  

## Continue making commits

Can continue to make commits and push to branch, and changes will be added to pull request.

## Merge

When you're done for the day or what have you, you can merge things to the main branch on GitHub.  You'll be given the option to delete the branch, which is a good time to do that.
