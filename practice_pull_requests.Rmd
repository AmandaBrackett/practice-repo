# Pull requests
 
Pull requests can take quite a few steps.  When making a pull request to your own repo, you first will want to make a new branch.  If you have no collaborators, worrying about upstream changes won't be as important. See some info [here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html#git-pullreq) in the R packages book.

You can make a new branch within RStudio or on GitHub (and then pull branch in).  Be sure to switch to new branch and start editing your first file.

## Make commit

Commit changes and push up to the branch.
