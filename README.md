# A practice repository for working sessions

This repository is for practicing merge conflicts using GitKraken, pull requests, and adding collaborators for Git repositories during the second summertime Git working session.

In particular, it can be difficult to experience a pull request as both the pullee and puller.  In a working session you can practice on known repositories from other attendees to see the entire process.

If you are working with collaborators (or even if you aren't), pull requests can be a way to work together and review changes before accepting them into your `main` branch. The process is similar to working with someone else's repo except you don't need to fork the repository. You will need to make a new branch for the pull request.
