# A practice repository for working sessions

This repository is for practicing merge conflicts, pull requests, and adding collaborators for Git repositories during the second summertime Git working session.

In particular, it can be difficult to experience a pull request as both the pullee and puller.  In a working session you can practice on known repositories to see the entire process.

I made a new branch and want to do a pull request.

I'm going to do a second edit now.
